Common-CLI

This is module was designed to make the life easier for those wanting to write
command line interface programs with Perl. For me, life is too short for copy
and paste calls and definitions for Getopt::Long, and validating its input
data.

So, basically Common::CLI is used to glue Getopt::Long and Data::FormValidator,
and let you focus on your business.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
